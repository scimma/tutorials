    "[SCIMMA](https://scimma.org/) is an NSF-funded, multi-institutional project to understand the needs for and develop cyberinfrastructure in support of multi-messenger astronomy (MMA).\n",

    "One such need is the ability to reliably and with low latency connect MMA experiments, follow-up facilities, and scientists. This has led to development of [Hopskotch](https://scimma.org/projects.html), **a clustered deployment of Apache Kafka strongly integrated with IAM systems common in research space (namely, [InCommon](https://www.incommon.org/) and [CILogon](https://www.cilogon.org/home))**.\n",

    "SCIMMA also operates [Hop.SCIMMA](https://hop.scimma.org) a deployment of Hopskotch-as-a-service that will be made available for MMA related projects and science. The goals of Hop.SCIMMA include:\n",
    "1. Provide a hub for MMA alert producers onto which they can publish their discoveries with very small latency (10s of ms), high reliability (no message loss), fine-grained permissions, and ease of use.\n",
    "1. Provide a hub to which MMA alert consumers (follow-up observatories, groups, individual scientists) can connect to receive MMA alerts, as well as publish enriched or transformed alerts.\n",
    "1. Provide a reliable, performant, easy to use, platform (PaaS) which projects and individuals can use to exchange messages and connect experiments."
